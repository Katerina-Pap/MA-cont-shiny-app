A worked out data example, including missing summary statistics, is provided as a default dataset. A data template is given under the [`Data upload and pre-processing`] tab and should be used to prepare your data accordingly, for example long format is required. 
- Use the 'Browse' button to upload your dataset and follow the steps to fill-in any missing data
- Once your dataset is full (no missing data), proceed to the [`View final data`] tab

The tool is designed to perform meta-analysis of continuous aggregate data (AD) measured at baseline (pre-treatment) and follow-up (post-treatment) [`Meta-Analysis`].

The available statistical approaches are:

- Standard AD: Final (follow-up) scores, Change scores, ANCOVA recovered estimates
- One-stage pseudo IPD ANCOVA
- Two-stage pseudo IPD ANCOVA

For details regarding the models analytical expressions and statistical calculations look at `Technical details`.

A worked example, including missing summary statistics, is provided as a default data set. A data template is given under the `Data upload and pre-processing` tab and should be used to prepare your data accordingly, for example long format is required. 
- Use the 'Browse' button to upload your data set and follow the steps to fill-in any missing data
- Once your data set is complete (no missing data), proceed to the `View final data` tab

The tool is designed to perform meta-analysis of continuous aggregate data (AD) measured at baseline (pre-treatment) and follow-up (post-treatment) under the  `Meta-Analysis` tab.

The available statistical approaches are:

- Standard AD: Final (follow-up) scores, Change scores, ANCOVA recovered estimates
- One-stage pseudo IPD ANCOVA
- Two-stage pseudo IPD ANCOVA

For details regarding the models' analytic expressions and statistical calculations see `About`.

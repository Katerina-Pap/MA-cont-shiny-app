## About the tool

`MA-cont: pre/post effect size` v0.1 is a complement of [Meta‐analysis of continuous outcomes: Using pseudo IPD created from aggregate data to adjust for baseline imbalance and assess treatment‐by‐baseline modification, Res Synth Methods July 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1434)

It enables the user to fit routinely used AD approaches and the novel pseudo IPD ANCOVA approach to meta-analyse continuous outcomes measured at baseline and follow-up.
More technical details on the model formulations is provided in the references above.

#### How to use the tool best?

We encourage the user to watch the video of instructions under the [`Home`] tab, demonstrating the functionalities of this app. 
Different methods of increasing complexity are applied and the output needs to be interpreted assuming a basic understanding of the models running in the backend. All code is freely available in [Github](https://github.com/Katerina-Pap/MA-cont-shiny-app).
